### About Me

I am a PhD student in Public Health Sciences at the University of Chicago, where my research focuses on health services and health policy. My work examines issues at the intersection of healthcare delivery, access, and outcomes, with a particular emphasis on Medicaid policy for individuals with substance use orders, adolescents with medically complex conditions and individuals in nursing homes. 

Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I trained in Health policy and Economics at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences (MS, 2020), Economics at the London School of Economics (MSc, 2018), and Economics at the University of Manchester (BSc, 2017).

My research has been published in JAMA Network Open, Health Affairs, Gastroenterology, and the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association. I have presented my work at the Academy Health Annual Research Meeting, the American Society of Health Economists Conference, and the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network.

At the University of Chicago, I have served as a teaching assistant for graduate-level courses in health services research and health economics. I previously worked as a research assistant at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.
