I am a PhD Candidate in Health Economics placed in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Chicago.

I use quasi-experimental methods with administrative claims data and qualitative research methods to inform Medicaid policy for vulnerable populations in the United States. 

I will be on the academic job-market for 2025-26.
